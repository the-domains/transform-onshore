# Welcome... To Transform Onshore!

Digital Transformation: What, Why, and How?

Welcome! This is the blog for Onshore Transformation: a new department within Onshore dedicated to exploring and directing Onshore toward the future of technology, industry, and employment.

In short, we own the Digital Transformation of Onshore's business to ensure sustainability and scalability well into the future, and we're excited to get started.

Let's start with some basics:

## What is digital transformation?

Depends on who you ask, but I'm going to loosely define it as the process by which a business responds to new and disruptive technologies entering the market.

Everything we're going to be doing falls into one of three categories:

### _Marketing & Education_

We'll be working to help our people and, eventually, our clients understand both the high-level impact and the specifics of how technology is evolving and the impact to our future.

### _Cultural Transformation_

Very much the underlying driver behind everything we need to achieve, Cultural Transformation will focus heavily around celebrating technological achievement and giving our best and brightest (that's you) the opportunity to show off their skills.

### _Product Development_

As we start to get good at these things, we're naturally going to want to do something about it. Thankfully, we already have some incredible resources in all of you, in your skills, and in our clients. Product Development is our chance to look for opportunities and drive forward projects, prototyping solutions for internal and external consumers and picking the best ideas to transform our business.

## Why is this important?

Faster than anticipated advancements in areas like [artificial][0][intelligence][1][and][2][robotics][3] have the potential to drive large reductions in employment as we think about it today: [knowledge-based and labor-based][4] respectively. We're not all doomed ([depending on who you ask][5]), and we've got the brainpower and the time to learn. However, if we don't start figuring out how to adapt, we're going to miss this incredible opportunity.

Also, most importantly, we get to play with some really cool stuff.

## How do we get started?

We're going to get started by setting up some infrastructure. Among other things, we'll be deploying a source code repository to which anyone at Onshore will be able to push projects. We'll also be getting this website set up, some blog posts on deck, and start exploring social media and other channels to optimize delivery of our message.

Once we've got some basics in place, we'll be sprinting forward, both with the education component and with some company-wide challenges to give everyone a chance to show off their new skills... And win some cool prizes while they're at it.

In the meantime, I'm going to do my best to check out Yammer more frequently to stay in touch with everyone interested in where we're going and to post about things that I find interesting and relevant to what we're doing. If you think all of this is exciting as I do, jump into the fray: shoot me an email, ping me on Skype/Yammer/text/etc., give me a call - you get the idea. I'm happy to hand you a [red pill][6].

As a teaser for those of you who made it this far: our first area of exploration will be artificial intelligence.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Dan
