  Last week, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur named Gabriel Leydon showed me the
  revolutionary potential of real-time bots. He showed me a test bot project
  that, if expanded, could almost literally run a country: its public
  transportation system, taxis, traffic lights, parking spaces, and more. That's
  a pretty bold vision.
